# Library-management-app
User friendly management application for my library database set up using XAMPP locally

Paste the contents in your XAMPP folder and just run the service as you normally would.

For this set of files to work "out of the box" you will need to have the exact same database structure I have, otherwise you will have to make the proper changes
to the files.

It is recommended that you just use the same databse structure I'm using
